All set for the [Cascadian Crossing Route 300](https://thecascadiancrossing300.home.blog), I think.

This year I’ve been learning more about the indigenous people of Oregon, specifically the tribes in the NE; the Cayuse, Umatilla, Walla Walla, and Nez Perce. I’ve learned that knowing the history and acknowledging the lands we live and recreate on is an important step. If you want to learn more about the land you’re on, a good starting place is [https://native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/).

This race passes through the ancestral lands of the Molalla, Yoncalla, Winefelly, Kalapuya, Klamath, and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs.
