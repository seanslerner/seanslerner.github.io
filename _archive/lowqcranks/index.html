Thinking about switching from a triple to a double on my Hillborne (mostly used for #rando these days). Any recommendations for a good relatively affordable crankset?</p>
<p><strong>thisisawkward</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
I think someone posted a link to some IRD crank offer‚Ä¶ try searching for IRD with Slack üîç</p>
<p><strong>thisisawkward</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
also I guess that means 46/30 or equivalent?</p>
<p><strong>seanlerner</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
Yeah, 46/30 is what I‚Äôm thinking. I‚Äôll look into IRD. Thanks!</p>

Speaking of the past, Mike has a great deal on these<br>
super-compact cranks right now. Best price I‚Äôve seen:<br>

<p><strong>seanlerner</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
Just was looking at that. Looks like they only have 165 in stock :/ too short me</p>
<p><strong>thisisawkward</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
holy‚Ä¶ there are also suginos but they are so expensive</p>
<p><strong>thisisawkward</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
if you don‚Äôt care about the looks there‚Äôs FSA Tempo in 46/30 which is supercheap</p>
<p><strong>tuckerfrancis</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
Do they still make the sunXCD stuff? I have their 50.4bcd double and it‚Äôs great</p>
<p><strong>William</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
i just did this for my atlantis, ended up just doublizing my tripple</p>
<p><strong>William</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
meanwhile, i put a sunxcd on my legolas</p>
<p><strong>William</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
28/44 on the sunxcd and 26/42 on the doublized sugino</p>
<p><strong>William</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
sunxcd is a great deal for what it is but nothing‚Äôs cheaper than the crankset you already have‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>seanlerner</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
Very true</p>
<p><strong>seanlerner</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
Part of the reason for the change is trying to get a narrower Q though, so I think new cranks are the only choice</p>
<p><strong>William</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
ah, yeah a doublized crank aint a good solution there</p>
<p><strong>William</strong>   [3 days ago]<br>
i dunno what the Q is on the sunxcd</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
welcome to the ongoing search for an affordable, available, low q, silver, not-ugly 46/30 subcompact crankset. it might as well be a channel at this point</p>
<p><strong>JustinAugust</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
Rene Herse, IRD, Doubleize a 110/74 crank or go looking for an older Ritchey or Sr 94bcd or a Deore 94bcd</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
if you go the 94bcd route, make sure you check the original intended bb spindle length - make sure you can subtract ~15mm and it still results in a bb you can buy. otherwise you‚Äôre not gonna get low Q and your chainline will be off.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
hey also this one I saw at blue lug yesterday that I‚Äôd never seen before:<br>

<p><strong>Adem</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
oh yah, the compass knockoff</p>
<p><strong>Adem</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
i‚Äôve only seen the catalog photo, never seen one in the wild</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
Sugino Impel and XC Pro Microdrive looked like good 94bcd options too</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
also @seanlerner sorry my bad I bought the last IRD in 170mm from the boulder site</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
for 94 bcd you‚Äôre talking MTB cranksets, though, right?  so nothing is going to have a terribly narrow Q factor</p>
<p><strong>The_Meat</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
the answer is still ‚Äúco-op touring triple with a bash guard instead of an outer ring‚Äù :atmo:</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
that is a very legit answer.</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
the other answer is live with 110 bcd.   now that cassettes have so many gears you can still get a 1:1 ratio and a decent number of hops between big and small</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
then the world of cheap, low-q cranks is before you</p>
<p><strong>seanlerner</strong>   [2 days ago]<br>
Well, I think I might go with the IRD set. A bike shop friend said he‚Äôd sell em to me at the Boulder price. Looks like my current cranks (Sugino XD2) have a Q of ~165 and the IRDs will be ~143 so that should be good. Thanks everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
@Jim N. I think there‚Äôs certain cranks (the deore, Sugino microdrive?) that originally had a long-ish bb spindle to go with that higher q, so when you subtract 15mm off the spindle length for chainline you get reasonably low q</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
yes i think you‚Äôre right.  i wish i knew exactly which ones those are, though!  like, the era before the wide-bend crank arm.</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
if you find out, please let us know</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
though as i said, for me 110 is pretty fine.  a 34:32 is about the lowest gear i need</p>
<p><strong>Adem</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
Shimano FC-6206 and FC-M730 were both designed for 120mm+ spindles, so they‚Äôre nice for adapting into low-Q 110BCD doubles</p>
<p><strong>Adem</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
unfortunately all of the Shimano 94/58 cranks were designed for short spindles (107mm generally), so no narrow-Q 46/30 doubles on those.<br>
IIRC the ritchey compact 94/58 and Suntour XC Pro Microdrive 94/56(!) triples used 113-115mm spindles, so you can pull the chainline in a <em>little</em> for use as a double - and they were both pretty narrow Q to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
good stuff.  thanks @Adem</p>
<p><strong>Adem</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
caution on the FC-6206/M730: both designed for asymmetric spindles. I‚Äôm running the 6206 on one bike, ended up with a symmetric cartridge BB (UN55, what else), offset to one side with a spacer</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
Good to know.  How much did you have to offset it?  I‚Äôve spaced a lot of cranksets just because i have an irrational dislike of mismatched Q</p>
<p><strong>Adem</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
lol i just went back and looked at my build doc and it‚Äôs weirder than i thought.<br>
fc-6206 driveside crank, FC-M560 non-driveside crank, 113mm spindle offset ~2.5mm to the driveside. Basically just mixed&amp;matched some stuff until the Q was symmetric and the cranks were both really close to the chainstays</p>
<p><strong>The_Meat</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
I feel like I need to copy-paste all this info to somewhere more permanent than Slack</p>
<p><strong>Adem</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
the 6206 is designed around a 121.5mm spindle, m560 is designed around a 113mm spindle. IIRC I had trouble getting it narrow + symmetric Q with just the 6206 arms and the BBs i had lying around.</p>
<p><strong>Adem</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
but I had a spare m560 arm, so‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>JustinAugust</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
If you email Joe Bunik from the Riv list with requirements of crank he‚Äôll let you know what he has. It‚Äôs like retrogrouch shopping without knowing the inventory</p>
<p><strong>seanlerner</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
@The_Meat BCC needs a wiki üò¨</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
could maybe be an article on the web site?</p>
<p><strong>geojoek</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
Echo the cranks @Adem is talking about.  You may also want to look at a Sugino AT or VP, which are similar.  I‚Äôm getting a Q of about 132 with Sugino VPs and a‚Ä¶ uhh‚Ä¶ I think a 122mm spindle.  And a Q of 137 on a Deore FC MT60. :q:</p>
<p><strong>Adem</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
Yeah if you‚Äôre looking for a 110 double, there are a bunch of good sugino models</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
yeah this thread should be archived for posterity there‚Äôs a lot of good info in here</p>
<p><strong>geojoek</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
Can one storify a Slack thread?</p>
<p><strong>Jim N.</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
@geojoek are you using that deore as a triple?  i‚Äôm surprised you are able to shoehorn a little ring in there, if so.  what frame?</p>
<p><strong>geojoek</strong>   [1 day ago]<br>
@Jim N. Just as a double on the Romeo.  I think I have it on a 127 mm spindle.</p>
<p><strong>swirving</strong>   [23 hours ago]<br>
Late to the party, but how low of a Q-factor are you looking for @seanlerner?</p>
<p><strong>swirving</strong>   [23 hours ago]<br>
My favorite budget crank recommendation is the SPA Cycles Super Compact crankset, which is essentially a Rivendell Wide/Low but with lower q-factor at 156 (not as low as Reen Hurs but lower than a White Industries R30)</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also like under $120 shipped with chainrings, bashguard and a bottom bracket: <a href="https://www.spacycles.co.uk/m2b0s109p3383/SPA-CYCLES-Super-Compact-Chainset-with-Zicral-Rings">https://www.spacycles.co.uk/m2b0s109p3383/SPA-CYCLES-Super-Compact-Chainset-with-Zicral-Rings</a><br>

@swirving I don‚Äôt have a specific Q in mind, just narrower than my Sugino XD2 triple‚Äôs ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>
