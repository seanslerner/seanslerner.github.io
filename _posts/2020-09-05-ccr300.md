I’m still gathering my thoughts on the [Cascadian Crossing Route 300](https://thecascadiancrossing300.home.blog), but my top 5 favorite / least favorite parts were:

Top 5

- descending Santiam (once it got good) during golden hour
- the climb out of Cougar Reservoir
- Alpine to Westfir
- descending Fuji
- Metolius-Windigo after Waldo

Bottom 5

- Bunchgrass
- walking downhill in sand on Santiam (before it got rideable)
- Waldo
- the ~5 miles before Sisters
- COD just before Bend
